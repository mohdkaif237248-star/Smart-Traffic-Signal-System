Smart Traffic Signal System - 2 Road Version
Files in this folder:
1. traffic_logic.c       - C program (logic)
2. signal_simulation.py  - Python turtle visual simulation
3. Output_Screenshot.png - Sample output image (for report)
4. Mini_Project_Report.pdf - Final report in English
5. README.txt            - This file

How to run:

A) C program:
   - Compile:
       gcc traffic_logic.c -o traffic_logic
   - Run:
       ./traffic_logic
   - Provide integer inputs for vehicle counts when prompted.

B) Python simulation:
   - Requires Python 3 and 'turtle' (standard library).
   - Run:
       python3 signal_simulation.py
   - A small window will appear and you'll be asked for vehicle counts using GUI dialogs.
   - Note: In some headless systems (remote servers) turtle may not work.

C) Report:
   - Open Mini_Project_Report.pdf using any PDF reader.

Contents:
- This is a simple college-level mini project with C logic deciding which road gets green signal based on vehicle counts, and a Python turtle animation to visualize the traffic lights.
